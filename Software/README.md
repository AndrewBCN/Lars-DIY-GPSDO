# Lars DIY-GPSDO Software
The file [Lars_gpsdo_30_170801.ino](Lars_gpsdo_30_170801.ino) is the original, unchanged Arduino sketch published by **Lars Walenius** in the EEVblog Forum on August 2017. Note that Lars never changed a single line in his original Arduino sketch, so we have neither later nor earlier versions of his GPSDO firmware.

## How to contribute?

Contributors wishing to publish their modified versions of Lars' Arduino sketch should create subdirectories here (under /Software) with their sketch name as the subdirectory name (i.e. following Arduino conventions) and any documentation, PDF, schematics, etc files in the same directory.
