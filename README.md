Apparently Lars was the only member of his family with any interest in electronics, and I believe he wanted other electronics hobbyists to have full access to his project, this is why putting the project under an Open Source license while retaining Lars Walenius copyrights seems the right thing to do.

These files are here in this repository for reference only. If you have any questions or comments about Lars' DIY GPSDO project please post them in the EEVblog thread.
